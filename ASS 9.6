1. Explain about the different complex data types in pig

Atom
• Any single value in Pig Latin, irrespective of their data or type is known as an Atom
A piece of data or a simple atomic value is known as a field.

Example − ‘rani’ or ‘30’

Tuple

• A record that is formed by an ordered set of fields is known as a tuple, the fields can
be of any type. 

Example- (aravind,20)

Bag

• A bag is an unordered set of tuples.
• In other words, a collection of tuples (non-unique) is known as a bag
•A bag can have duplicate tuples.
•A bag can have tuples with differing numbers of fields. However, if Pig tries to access a field that does not exist, a null value is substituted.
•A bag can have tuples with fields that have different data types.

Example − {(Rani, 30), (Mohan, 45)}

Map

• A map (or data map) is a set of key-value pairs. 
•  The key needs to be of type chararray and should be unique.
• The value might be of any type. It is represented by ‘[]’

Example: [name#Rani, age#39]

2. How can you interact with the shell in Apache pig

pig shell can be interacted in two ways.They are

                      1) With Grunt shell.
                      2) Using script files.
                      
With Grunt Shell

• Interactive Shell for executing Pig Commands
• Used when script file is not provided
• Can execute scripts from Grunt via run or exec commands 

Using Script Files:

• Executes Commands in a file
• pig ScriptFile.pig
• Pig commands are executed using script files as batch Jobs

3. Explain how pig differs from Map reduce

PIG:

1) Apache Pig is a data flow language.	
2) It is a high level language.	
3) Performing a Join operation in Apache Pig is pretty simple.	
4) Any novice programmer with a basic knowledge of SQL can work conveniently with Apache Pig.	
5) Apache Pig uses multi-query approach, thereby reducing the length of the codes to a great extent.	
6) There is no need for compilation. On execution, every Apache Pig operator is converted internally into a MapReduce job.	

MAP REDUCE:

1) MapReduce is a data processing paradigm.
2) MapReduce is low level and rigid.
3) It is quite difficult in MapReduce to perform a Join operation between datasets.
4) Exposure to Java is must to work with MapReduce.
5) MapReduce will require almost 20 times more the number of lines to perform the same task.
6) MapReduce jobs have a long compilation process.

4. Explain how pig differs from sql

PIG:

1) Pig Latin is a procedural language.	
2) In Apache Pig, schema is optional. We can store data without designing a schema (values are stored as $01, $02 etc.)	
3) The data model in Apache Pig is nested relational.	
4) Apache Pig provides limited opportunity for Query optimization.

SQL :

1) SQL is a declarative language.
2) Schema is mandatory in SQL.
3) The data model used in SQL is flat relational.
4) There is more opportunity for query optimization in SQL.
